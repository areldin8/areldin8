I have been studying Java for almost two years with the goal of shifting my career priorities. Gradually, I have been gaining practical experience in development and implementing projects aimed at solving real-world problems. My experience includes creating console games and utilities for data analysis, as well as developing web applications using frameworks like Spring and Javalin.

## Key Skills

- Designing and implementing object-oriented solutions.
- Writing automated tests using JUnit to ensure high code quality.
- Experience with integration testing and logging to enhance application reliability.
- Proficient use of Git and the command line.
- Working with databases such as PostgreSQL and understanding the principles of RESTful API.
- Data processing and validation in various formats (JSON, YAML).
